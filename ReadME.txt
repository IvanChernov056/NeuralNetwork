    Project: Neural Network
    Description: Implementation of constructer and tester of different neural networks on C++

Hi everyone!

I am glad that you interested in this project!
 But, in my opinion, you should not use it at all. Because if you 
 realy want to lean some Neural Networks API, jsut use Python with Keras
 or any other existing API. They are simpler, faster and better that my
 solution.
 
The main goal of this project is to compare the different castom 
 networks by speed and accuracy. So, i need to know the complexity of 
 using algorithms exactly, therefore, i want to write them myself.
